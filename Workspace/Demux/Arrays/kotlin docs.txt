// val for value, it cannot be reassigned

// var for variable, can be reassigned but type of variable can be reassigned only once

// var f: String -> cannot do this due to no initialization
// val f: String -> same reason
// Do late initialization as we can assign some value later to it as well
// lateinit must have a type declaration

// null safe ? tells this variable can hold null

// val len: Int = g?.length!!
// !! means irrespective of type of variable, we are using it to not null
// val len = g?.length!! -> this also causes crash due to null pointer exception
// this was wrong because we cannot be sure if len is not null but still
// we are using it as not null by adding !! at the end

// using elvis operator to set default value in case if left value is null

// type declaration becomes mandatory if you’re not initializing the variable(var) or value(val) at the time of declaration
